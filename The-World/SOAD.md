## Prison Song
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison

Following the rights movement, you clamped on with your iron fists
Drugs became conveniently available for all the kids
Following the rights movement, you clamped on with your iron fists
Drugs became conveniently available for all the kids

I buy my crack, my smack, my bitch right here in Hollywood
(Nearly two million Americans are incarcerated in the prison system, prison system of the US)

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
(For you and me to live in)
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
(For you and me)

Minor drug offenders fill your prisons you don't even flinch
All our taxes paying for your wars against the new non-rich
Minor drug offenders fill your prisons you don't even flinch
All our taxes paying for your wars against the new non-rich

I buy my crack, my smack, my bitch right here in Hollywood
(The percentage of Americans in the prison system, prison system, has doubled since 1985)

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
(For you and me to live in)
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
(For you and me)

For you and I, you and I, you and I
You and I

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison for you and me
Oh, baby, you and me
Oh
Oh

All research and successful drug policy show that treatment should be increased (Oh)
And law enforcement decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences (Oh)
All research and successful drug policy show that treatment should be increased (Oh)
And law enforcement decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences

Utilising drugs to pay for secret wars around the world
Drugs are now your global policy, now you police the globe

I buy my crack, my smack, my bitch right here in Hollywood
Drug money is used to rig elections and train brutal corporate sponsored dictators around the world

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
(For you and me to live in)
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
(For you and me)
For you and I, you and I, you and I
You and me
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison for you and me
Oh, baby, you and me


## Deer Dance
Circumventing circuses lamenting in protest
To visible police, presence sponsored fear
Battalions of riot police with rubber bullet kisses
Baton courtesy, service with a smile
Beyond the Staples Center you can see America
With its tired, poor, avenging disgrace
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence

Pushing little children with their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children with their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around

A rush of words, pleading to disperse
Upon your naked walls, alive
A political call, the fall guy accord
We can't afford to be neutral on a moving train
Beyond the Staples Center you can see America
With its tired, poor, avenging disgrace
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence

Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
Push them around

A deer dance, invitation to peace
War staring you in the face, dressed in black
With a helmet, fierce
Trained and appropriate for the malcontents
For the disproportioned malcontents
A little boy smiled, it'll all be well
And say a little boy smiled, it'll all be well

Pushing little children with their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children with their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children with their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around

Push the weak around
Push the weak around
Push the weak around
They like to push the weak around
