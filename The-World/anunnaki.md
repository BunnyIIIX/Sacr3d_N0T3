About  the two gatekeeper beings are actually symbols to the
2 parts/section of the organs found in the human brain..the
two parts serve as judges to determine whether a person is
worthy for ascension or not..all one's deeds are recorded in
the pineal gland since childhood and including also every
previous reincarnation, which is this two beings often
depicted holding pine cone or with pine cone near them..
Matters relating to the two beings who are judges,  about
reincarnation, about good and bad deeds are recorded
permanently in one place and also about ascension is written
in almost every ancient book including religious books...
