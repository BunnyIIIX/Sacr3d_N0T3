## Unlock Bootloader - Honor Play

Unlock Bootloader of Huawei for Free using an Unofficial method. This
easy steps guide will assist you in downloading Huawei bootloader unlock
tool. Almost every Android OEM company releases its smartphones with a
locked bootloader.

But if you want to root Android, install TWRP or CWM custom recovery,
flash custom ROM like LineageOS, you must unlock the bootloader. Android
phones like Samsung, Motorola, OnePlus, and Google can be modified
easily.

It is possible to root these smartphones or install a custom ROM. But
unfortunately, companies like Huawei are not friendly towards
customization or modifications. The bootloader is a code or program that
runs when you boot up your Android phone.

It consists of instructions to start the operating system RAM and
kernel. Device manufacturers lock bootloaders to make sure that users
stick to their official Stock ROM. Unfortunately, Huawei has officially
closed the bootloader unlocking process from 25th July
2018.

The main reason behind this was multiple system issues occurred due to
unauthorized modifications. This method provides a dc unlocker username
and password free.

## [What is DC-Unlocker?](#What_is_DC-Unlocker)

Here, we'll answer your question of How to unlock a Huawei android
device's bootloader without an unlock code. Till last year, Huawei used
to provide bootloader unlock code from their official EMUI website.

However, users noticed many issues after unlocking the bootloader. Some
of which were a system failure, boot loops, increased power consumption,
etc. There are many advantages and disadvantages of unlocking
bootloaders on Android.

The main benefits of bootloader unlocking are rooting, flashing custom
ROM, and installing mods like Magisk, Xposed, SuperSU, etc. The
disadvantages include the warranty getting void, chances of bricked
devices, and problems in receiving official software updates.

There are many third-party services to unlock the bootloader of your
device. But unfortunately, these are paid services and priced from 20\$
to 50\$ to get the bootloader to unlock the code.

Some of these paid services include FunkyHuawei, Ministry of Solutions,
and Global Unlocking Solutions. You can either provide them your mobile
IMEI number or model, serial number, and firmware, and they usually send
the unlock code through email.

You can even find various Huawei bootloader code generators on the
Internet, but most of them are spam or viruses. Here we will use
DC-unlocker 2 client crack version to unlock the bootloader of Huawei
devices.
