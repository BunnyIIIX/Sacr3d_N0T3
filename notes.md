# Notes


Unlike me, no one in my family wants to hear my words ...
They also said that I am stupid and talk nonsense .. My
father suddenly suffered kidney damage after the vaccine..My
mother is still hesitant even after my repeated advice has
already been proven, she is still hesitant because before
this, she also hated me..It's hard to be the 'black sheep' in
the family moreover being the youngest.. I understand, ego
dominates them ... even though they clearly see the
difference between them and me (in knowledge and
understanding of this reality) , they still against me ...
sad, angry, guilt all mixed, because no matter what, í failed
to help them, to help all of my beloved family... i dont care
for the hate they gave me, i love them no matter what,
just please listen to my words even if only once...
if only I could change my fate with them, I would change
immediately...i'm not afraid to die, but im afraid to see
all of my loved ones might have to suffer...

**After Image**

I feel quiet.

As my thoughts liquify they become rapidly increasing images of
abstract art.

Impossible to see. Impossible to her.

Yet here I am, seeing them and hearing them.

My body feels heavy. My skin feels soft.

My mind is a cloud, and it wants to come out.

So it does.

And it floats around the room, in a subtle fit of wonder and awe.

I look down upon myself, contemplating how I got here in the
first place.. I never thought I’d make it this far.

I feel the warm embrace of the terrifyingly vast abyss consume
me, as it becomes one with my being.

I gently coast out of my shell and become my soul as my eyelids
are ripped a little bit wider.

And I can’t explain why, But I’m hurting inside.

Here I am now. Connected with the source.

At the doorstep on the intangible, that will remain on the tip
of my tongue for life.

No matter how hard I try, this night remains forever Ineffable.

And as I melt into my authentic fabric beneath my typical form
that all my atoms and cells work so hard to materialize, I can’t
even cry.

I don’t know what I feel.

I’m happy, I’m sad. I’m old, I’m young.

I’m dead, I’m alive. I’m gone, I’m new.

I’m a forever recyclable energy, designed to travel internally.

I think of all that we are, together. I think of all the things
we mistake.

We are not from earth. We are earth.

We are trees. We are leaves. We are dirt. We are bees. We are
wind. We are breeze. We are lust. We are greed. We are war. We
are peace. I am you. You are me.

We are individualized infinity, dancing with each other in a
chaotic spiral of cosmic anxiety,

Reflecting ourselves in who we love and what we do. Desperately
trying to hold onto what is constantly fleeting and relentlessly
changing with the tides.

But we do what we can. We love, we sing, we dream, we explore.

And I would never trade this for anything.

I feel profoundly overwhelmed with gratitude and a strange
melancholia I can’t quite put my finger on. Perhaps because I’ve
never truly appreciated this life til just now.

The raw and brutal, unforgiving beauty of it all.

What a strange feeling… Looking back on our sliver of time, all
the way out here in the great jaws of God. Whatever the hell that
is.

It doesn’t matter.

I know now that I know nothing.

Out here.. I feel so small.

Right now.. we are so young.

I hear voices in my head, from what we’re made of.

They say Oceans make the sound, of your heart. And your lungs.

Love is forever. So never be afraid. The universe is watching, in
a really friendly way.

Nobody truly knows. No matter what you think. Tomorrow isn’t
real. Yesterday’s decayed. You only have the now. You only have
today.

Life can be confusing. And I have been in pain. But I truly
wouldn’t have it, Any other way.


I hear this mantra beamed into my soul and carved into my ribs
with each breath I struggle to obtain.

I feel like a baby.

Exposed. Alone. Confused.

Most of all, I feel empty.

I have no concepts. No culturally influenced perceptions. No
sociological habits that strain my mind and guide it towards any
form of bias. I am raw energy. I am fundamental consciousness.

And it is forever peaceful.

Heaven is silent.

Heaven is real.

And a part of me misses it everydaya

Thank you so much, may God continue to strengthen our hearts
to withstand the insults from those who do not understand and
never want to understand .. they close and prevent their own
hearts from being illuminated by the light of guidance from
Allahh... It's so sad, but this is what Allah wants us to
witness so that we can always remember, aware and understand
what is the truth (Haq) and what is falsehood (Batil)..


## Human are God Expression

God are not a thing, object, species, word, or anything.
We cannot be describe by anything because averything
that can be describe are God's creation.
God expressed it self trough His creation.
For example:
- Human have many skill, averyone have a different sets
  of skill which can be use to navigate in this world.
  For example:
    - God is the master of creativity which can
      be experienced trough art.
    - God is the most knowing and intelligent which can
      be seen by studying and observing the universe.

      the earth which produce eclipse)


## Thought is like a river

* Imagine there is a river, the water is clear and
  you can clearly see that there's alot of sharp
  stick or stone that could harm you if you step on it.
* Imagine if you jump into the river and you really
  step on that sharp thing. Due to the pain of stepping
  on it that is, the legs will weaken and cause you
  to fall and drown into the river.


## Shattering The Living Organism

* With 2 input frequencies, for example:-
  - Headphone setup: `Left = Low` and `Right = High`.
  - The higher frequency must be `11x (eleven times)`
    the lower, which is `right` frequency must be
    `11x (eleven times)` the `left`.
  - For musicians, this is called `eleven harmonic`
  - Micro organism begin to shattered when we add 
    `eleven harmonic`.

### Destroying the corrupted micro organism 
* `Cancer` & `Leukemia`:
  - Between 100,000hz to 300,000hz.


## You are different my friends
Please...Please always remember this, we as a human being are
so special.. We have a very special gift given to us by
God/Higher Self/Source or whatever you called ... The gift is
the 'free will'.. Some people may think 'free will' are
nonsense but for me its a very very special gift... Please
remember, nothing can stop or trap you as long as you are
alive on this earth. You have many advantages, you can do
sooo many things that you never thought possible. There is
nothing that cannot be cured in this world.  please, don't
give up, keep seeking knowledge, study and keep studying.. Do
some research about our brain, how it work, how all the
glands work, how to excited/use Vegus Nerve, how to connect
heart and brain, and many many more things... believe me,
you'll be surprise to know how much we can do...Remember
this,  they won't be able to do anything to you as long as
you don't admit defeat, as long as you still breathing...
Please don't give up, I understand how you feel .. All my
family, my mom, my dad, brother, sister, nephew, brother in
law, cousins, averyone got that j@bs .. No one listen to me,
sometimes it feels very lonely, i miss my mom and dad and
family soo much.. They changed, they really  changed..They
are not the same anymore .. but, it's because they don't
realize it, they don't want to wake up, they dont even want
to realize or try to understand what is it.. But You, It's
different.. People who are aware and understand like you,
it's different.  please, don't give up... Promise me my dear
friend...
