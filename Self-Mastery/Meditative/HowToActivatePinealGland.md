The pineal gland is the gland found in the center of the
brain near the optic chasm and is sometimes called the third
eye. It has many important functions

### How to excite pituitary gland?

I have a question. I am a little confused on the hormones
that affect the pituitary gland.
My teacher told me that the pituitary gland is controlled by
the hypothalamus. He said that the pituitary gland secretes
the hormones that affect the hypothalamus.
I don't understand how the pituitary gland controls the
hypothalamus.

The pituitary gland is called the master gland because it
produces hormones that regulate other glands. These hormones
are called Gonadotropins (Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)
and Luteinizing Hormone (LH)). These hormones are produced in
the anterior pituitary gland and travel through the blood
stream to the ovaries. The ovaries then produce the sex
hormones estrogen and progesterone.

The hypothalamus in turn produces the Pituitary Gland Hormone
Releasing Hormone (PRH). This hormone travels to the anterior
pituitary gland and stimulates the release of the
gonadotropins.

The hypothalamus also produces the Hypothalamic Gonadotropin
Releasing Hormone (GnRH). This hormone travels to the
anterior pituitary gland and stimulates the release of the
gonadotropins.

The hypothalamus also produces the Thyrotropin Releasing
Hormone (TRH). This hormone travels to the anterior pituitary
gland and stimulates the release of the gonadotropins.

The hypothalamus also produces the Growth Hormone Releasing
Hormone (GHRH). This hormone travels to the anterior
pituitary gland and stimulates the release of the
gonadotropins.

The hypothalamus also produces the Prolactin Releasing
Hormone (PRH). This hormone travels to the anterior pituitary
gland and stimulates the release of the gonadotropins.

The hypothalamus also produces the Thyroid Stimulating
Hormone (TSH). This hormone travels to the anterior pituitary
gland and stimulates the release of the gonadotropins.

The hypothalamus also produces the Adrenocorticotropic
Hormone (ACTH). This hormone travels to the anterior
pituitary gland and stimulates the release of the
gonadotropins.

The hypothalamus also produces the Thyroid Stimulating
Hormone (TSH). This hormone travels to the anterior pituitary
gland and stimulates the release of the gonadotropins.

The hypothalamus also produces the Adrenocorticotropic Horm


### How to activate Pineal Gland
Firstly,you must visualize light between your eyes, like
star lights, only brighter and higher more intense, do this
before your meditation,continue with your meditation, after a
while of meditation it should lighten.
Try again only two days apart, wait 3 days.
Every two to three days have noticed the meditation became twice as intense.
Also feel much lighter mentally as your meditation process comes on.
I'm praying it is happening for everyone the good way! During
meditation for extended periods I suggest the body being
mindful and 'in awareness' at the level of the joints as
there will not be a full body awareness unless a new sense is
felt. At times it's nice to just sit, in peace, be in the
current without fear, just live from the 'low-level' sense of
'what is'.
During moments of intense spiritual/energetic thoughts you
need not reject it as you would need a rest by not-engaging
with the strong thoughts and try to focus just the Pineal
part.
