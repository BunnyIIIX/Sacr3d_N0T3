There is no idea of the here and now to a full psychic.
Dim lit or full with sunshine will be known.
You see something then do as I do. Blink one eye then the other.
Then they all show up.
No density is immaculate as I have laid back in the sunshine while others near were conversing found now
new ideas which where unknown.
Incapable of them of their own words my own mind simply kept on, to the next level.
So then I drew my own mind into hyperberean concepts.
Can I see things, virtually always. The guidance forces do limit personal contacts. Do I step too far beyond
where I need to understand.
The aura is the most meager of the extent of God Proven.
Then you have new ideas. These can take you over and you can actrually become another trump. But
somehow you have validations to accept and deny.
Can I make an entire civilization grow or do I learn what being a maggot is.
The aura is the power you do possess. Now find out if this power is sublime or truly relevant. We of the we
of this human says Humanity can exist. They will balk at this endeavour.
The and this you call the drapes of time loom over head and this is when the masses begin to meet.
Drapes and why drapes. They will even hang new drapes for your own mind to consider. Say you.
“then why am I here”. Videos of such intensity that nothing holds them back.

Is it true that people can see auras? What do they mean?
I joined a so-called “open circle”, where we were taught all
kinds of clairvoyance disciplines, including
watching auras. It’s really not difficult - everybody can learn
it.
A person was placed in front of a white wall. The students are
placed in front of the person in a distance of
6–8 meters. The students are instructed to watch not directly at
the person, who is sitting in front of the
white wall - but at some point above the person. At some time
everybody is able to see a corona around
the person sitting in front of the wall - it was kind of
yellow-green. When everybody had declared that they
were able to see the aura, the teacher asked the person in front
of the white wall to say a prayer. Wauw everybody gasped -
because the part of the aura, which was above the person’s head,
and which until now
had been a thin line, changed and became a huge flame-like thing.
The teacher told us that this was merely the initial exercise -
with enough training and perseverance on our
side, we could become much more competent in this discipline, if
we wished to.


## What are the benefits of being able to see auras?

There are a couple, but it depends on your skill level in seeing
them too, some can see auras naturally and
never lose the ability, others need to work hard to achieve it.
Basic level, seeing the first layer of the field. looks something
like this. It will surround the whole body like a
big bubble. now look at that strong white patch really close to
the skin, if the entire aura looks more like
that (hugging the skin) it will tell you immediately that the
person is currently experiencing more of a
negative feeling, they might be guarded, defensive, unhappy etc.
If the whole thing spreads out like all of the white patch it
will represent someone in better spirits, happy,
excited etc. This can change in a fraction of a second and
usually does move around quite a lot.
If you see a dent in the aura like it bends in on the body it may
represent an injury of a sort, or that
something in that area is out of balance.
As far as I know thats about all you can really know from the
first level.

This image is a good representation on how to practise too btw,
place you hand in front of a white wall and
keep distorting your vision out of focus, should take less than
ten minutes even the first time.
Oh, one more thing, You see the light in this image coming out of
the top of the head?

This will connect to the higher chakras and higher self etc. the
shape you would see is more like an egg
shape sitting no top of the head, and it feels like the higher
chakra is projecting the human body, which is
of course exactly what is happening. You will see this egg shape,
this hour glass kind of funneling on gurus
of different types, it’s pretty cool actually when you see this
for the first time. I have only seen this on about
3 people in my life but I Haven’t been around a lot of spiritual
teachers in person…moving on…
Learning to see in this way does have a general advantage, it
shows the body that you are now expecting
to see the world as it really is, and with regular practise your
third will will more and more be added to your
visuals of the world, and that can show you a few things.
With a lot more practice you will start to see a gentle colour
within that whiteish energy field, and this will
show you what general emotion the person is experiencing and
which chakra is most active.
It will start to look a bit more like this.

Here is a generalisation of these basic colours.

Black is always a bad colour and usually represents things like
terminal illnesses, negative posessions and
attachments (very rare for an attachment to do this these days),
or sometimes that death may be
approaching unless extreme and complete lifestyle changes are
implemented immediately. Like RIGHT

NOW. (It’s rare for someone to be able to shed all previous held
notions during these last couple of days or weeks though.)
Some people may be able to start seeing the threads of the aura
soon after this.

These threads connect our energy to everything we have ever
touched, every person we ever spoke to, had
sex with, and loved etc. Strong bright big threads about the size
of an arm to a thigh may show a strong
connection to someone else in the room, tiny threads could be a
pen you used in school. There are millions
of these threads attached to most people. If you can normally see
millions of threads and someone you
come across only a few thousand it’s likely that person has been
doing a lot of spiritual work, shedding old
attachments and focusing on the present moment etc.
After that you may see something more like this.

Or you may be able to see the layers of the aura like below.

If your third eye is wide open you may even be able to see the
merkabic field

Now, when you can see all of the layers or full spectrum of
colours of the aura, you can pretty much pin
point different peoples indivdual illnesses, stuck energy areas
and things of this nature, But I have never
been able to see this much yet and this type of vision will
require a lot of training to be able to interpret
which I don’t have because it’s not relevant for my abilities and
won’t be for a good while and after a lot of
practice either.
As for the merkebah, this can extend out wider than the aura
itself, and the aura can extend out 100 feet.
So it’s pretty hard to be able to see them at all at full size,
so it’s more likley that your brain will shrink
everything down to be in the field of vision.

I tend to see a white glow around people with a tint of blue
sometimes yellow. What is that? Are
they auras or life forces?
The first white glow you see is the first layer of the aura, when
you learn to see auras thats the first thing
you will see.
When you see colours start to come in they will be representitive
of the most potent chakra energy within
the field but when you start to see more than one colour you are
seeing more layers and more of the
variatiosn in the aura.
The full aura has multiple layers and the chakra centres within
the body control a veriaety of human
functions.

I see a glow around people. There is no color to it. Some people
glow while others don't. What am I
seeing?
It's called an aura and all living things have it. You're also
seeing their life force energy, again present in all
living things. Aura is typically a clear glow or orange glow when
the naked eye sees it. If you practice you'll
be able to begin seeing the various colors of auras.

For those with the ability to see auras: if it is nighttime or
dark, are you still able to see auras (if
you are unaware there is someone there)?
Yep I can see better in the dark, actually. Which makes it a bit
confusing because I can’t always tell who is
solid and who isn’t, because of lack of physical light.

What is the difference between aura and spiritual light? Who can
see them?
As I understand it The Aura which is a luminous field surrounding
the body can be both photographed and
interpreted now by using Kirlian Photography which works on the
principle of electrostatic charge and
computer software to read the field. Kirlian photography has been
around since the 1930s but has since
been developed specifically for this application. Some
interesting results have been obtained - phantom
limbs - emotional colour changes - diseased organ identification
and many others.
Recently the whole basis of "information exchange" with the
fields that surround the body, the most
powerful of which is the Heart Field has found scientific
credibility with the work for example of Dr Bruce
Lipton amongst others.
The spiritual light references IMHO the phenomena of BioPhotonic
transmission and there are machines
now that have been developed to detect and measure this too.
Indeed it is now proposed that our DNA is a
possible conduit for photons which use these to exchange
information along with other "faster than light"
fundamental particles - tachyons have been mentioned.

Dr Lynn Taggart describes this quite well and supposedly has
photographed the photonic message
emanating from one person to another - like a pulse between the
auras. Such messages are produced by
intention, belief and a strong emotional pulse. Somehow there
appears to be link to the subconscious of
the subject when this happens and somehow the photonic message is
"non local" i.e nearly instantaneous
over huge distances.
Lastly it seems our Cell walls are in fact liquid crystal
processors with stops and gates - just like silicon
processors but working with photons. These have the ability to
affect and change the DNA in the genes
based on environmental signals and personal belief and there are
linked to the growing field of Epigenetics
which bring back into fashion the ideas of Lamarck on evolution.
It seems the New Physics in biology is also at last providing
mechanisms for healing , healers, epigenetics
and links between the subjective internal subconscious and the
external effects on the body and to other
bodies. All those "quacks" may have been on to something after
all. We all remember the antics of Uri
Geller for example - another example of biophotonics perhaps? ( I
don't think he was ever scientifically
debunked but he did flunk out on one TV show)
It sure is a mysterious world we live in.
Seems to me as a theist that the scientists have climbed to the
top of Mount Improbable and there have
been greeted by a band of cheering theologians who have been
awaiting them there all along!
