* Does anyone know what they say exactly in the Sufi Zikr
  dance in Chechnya?

It starts with this Dhikr (remembrance):

La Ilaha Illa Allah (لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله)

Meaning: There is no god but Allah

From 0:32 you can hear this in the background:

Allah Allah Allah... (ٱلله)

Meaning: Calling God repeatedly

Someone also starts chanting frequently from this point In
Chechen language.

They repeat those remembrances again and again. and this
video is just about 5 minutes of possibly 2 hours ceremony.
The ceremony also contains speeches and prays.

Note 1: This remembrance (Dhikr or Zikr) emphasize on the
unity of Allah, and they also perform this unity in the
ceremony by forming a circle and orbiting an imaginary core.
This remembers the Haj ceremony in which Muslims orbiting
Kaaba (not as an idol but a symbol of Gods presence in this
world)

The core of whole existence is Allah and this allegorical
ceremony recreates the universes circular and everlasting
motion around its core. (I'm not providing scientific facts
here. Of course, our ancestors inspired by the motion of
stars, the moon, and sun which orbiting earth -or universe
orbiting the sun- and they put themselves in a harmony with
it by performing some ceremonies maybe)

this circular movement has a point: the circular motion is
the only form of motions in which the moving doesn't go far
and doesn't get close. This journey won't end because God is
infinite.

Note 2: There are over 3000 comments below this video, many
of them dedicated to a dispute over the legality of the
ceremony according to Sharia (religious law). I don't want to
spread it to Quora, I just want to notice that how Muslims
are diverse and how the Islamic tradition bound to the
historical, geographical and cultural heritage of the native
people. We should be careful of the judgments which
generalize a particular and selective aspect of a religion,
like Islamic fundamentalism for instance.

* Are Sufis Muslims? Do Sufis believe in reincarnation? Can a
  Sufi be an atheist?

Originally Answered: Are Sufis Muslims? Do Sufis believe in
reincarnation? Can a Sufi be an antheist? Yes, Sufis are
Muslims. But for complete understanding, this must be
answered in two ways. First of all, there are many Sufis who
are members of the Muslim faith. Secondly, there are Sufis in
the world who are not members of the external religion of
Islam, yet still are Muslims.

Clearly, an explanation is in order, for too many people
don’t understand the deeper, universal meaning of what a
Muslim is. If they did understand it, your question would
have been unnecessary.

First and foremost, a Muslim is any person who strives, to
the best of their ability, to submit their individual human
will (ego) to the greater Will of Allah (God). Any person who
fits this description, even if they are not perfect, and no
matter what traditional religion they follow… is a Muslim.

This is Islam in the deeper, universal sense… in other words,
as Sufis understand it. That being said, there certainly are
people in the Islamic world who go by the name of Sufis, but
who yet offer a more fundamentalist idea of what Sufism is,
and what authentic Sufis must conform to. This is a result of
their having been influenced by fundamentalism within their
culture, so whatever they say must of course, be taken with a
grain of salt.

That being said…. historically, there have been some Sufi
orders and Sufi teachers who have initiated people of other
religions, and have not required conversion to the external
religion of Islam…. at least not in the sense of having to
leave their previous religion behind. Many inter-spiritual
Sufis who do not leave the religion of their birth behind,
yet also adopt some Islamic beliefs and practices. The famous
Jewish sage and historian Maimonides was initiated by an
Islamic Sufi master, and became a Sufi master in his own
right. Yet he remained a Jew. But he was a Jew who also
considered himself a Muslim, in the deeper spiritual sense
explained above. Maimonides initiated his own son in the
mysteries of Sufi practice in a Jewish context, and thus was
born a traditional Jewish Sufi lineage.

There have been Christian Sufis, and even Sufis of other
religions. The modern Sufi teacher Irina Tweedie, after being
guided in a series of visions to seek out a spiritual
personage who kept appearing to her, actually found that
person in India. He was an enlightened Sufi teacher in the
Naqshbandi lineage, who happened to be a Hindu (even though
most Naqshbandi Sufis are Muslims).

The Sufi teacher Hazrat Inayat Khan, the first person to
introduce Sufism to the Western world, did not require any of
his initiates to convert to Islam, though he was himself a
very devout Muslim. He was a devout Muslim who studied and
garnered spiritual wisdom from the scriptures of all the
religions of the world. His own Sufi teacher Abu Hashim
Madani - also a devout Muslim - encouraged Inayat’s study of
various religious scriptures, even though many of his fellow
students did not understand it, because they did not have the
same capacity for spiritual understanding. In time, Abu
Hashim Madani sent Inayat Khan to the West, and specifically
instructed him to initiate people without requiring
conversion to Islam. Of course, any of these initiates still
had the freedom to convert to Islam if they so desired.

This was not unusual, given Inayat Khan’s lineage in the
Chishti Sufi order. In past times, a famous Chishti Sufi
spiritual master who had hundreds of students, announced his
intention to travel to the temple of Kali in India, to
worship there. Most of his students, not understanding that
God can be understood in a multitude of ways, left him. Only
one student remained, who accompanied him on his journey,
with the explanation: “Teacher, the first lesson you taught
me was that only God exists. If this is true, how can it be
wrong for you to worship Allah under this other form?” At
this point, the teacher realized that he had finally found
his first real student, with the capacity to understand and
realize the teachings.

In modern times, a disciple of Inayat Khan named Murshid
Samuel Lewis, traveled to the East after his teachers’
passing. There, he met and was initiated by various Sufi
teachers, all of whom recognized him as an enlightened Sufi
teacher. One of these was the famous Pakistani Sufi saint Pir
Barkat Ali, who instructed Samuel that upon his return to
America, he was to teach “Christian Sufism” to the people
there.

You see, Sufism predates the religion of Islam that began
with the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). But the universal Islam of
the heart, has always existed, and Sufis of this universal
Islam have always existed.

And a real Sufi never interferes with the religion of
another. Rather, he simply offers guidance and friendship to
all, without bias against the path of any, to help them reach
their goal, regardless of the faith into which they are born,
or to which their own heart has guided them.

If you will begin to understand that in the truest sense, any
and all authentic religious practice (stemming from any
religious cultures), all constitute so many forms of this
eternal, universal Islam, then you will begin to understand
that all souls are on the path toward Sufism, which is the
state of spiritual perfection.

And there is no one religion that is the sole requisite for a
soul to trod this path.

There is one more aspect to your question that is a little
more difficult to answer, for the simple reason that the
average person is not familiar with the deeper, more subtle
aspects of religious practice and mystical experience… and
that is your question as to whether a Sufi can be an atheist.

Let us explore, for a moment, what theism is. Otherwise, we
will not understand what atheism is, in a deeper sense.

Theism is the idea that the Divine Source from which our own
lives, and indeed all of Creation, has come…. is a “Divine
Person.” Theism is by definition, an anthropomorphic
conception. In other words, the Infinite Being is defined
(and even limited within) metaphors related to human beings,
including the human form, and characteristics of the human
mind. Only, this metaphor is applied on a cosmic scale,
rather than a small, or individual one.

You must know, if you’ve never been told, that there are
indeed religions that strive toward the divine Source of our
being, but without conceiving it in anthropomorphic fashion.
Yet its practitioners are still deeply religious, in the
truest sense of the word. According to the original meaning
of the English word religion, stemming from the latin root
“ligare” (meaning to bind or unite), practitioners of these
other religions are yet striving towards union with this
divine source, even though they do not ascribe human
characteristics to it, or form of any kind.

In this category, would be any religion that has a deeply
non-dual emphasis, on the unity of existence, in which the
artificial line between creature and Creator is blurred.
Non-dual Vedanta philosophy, as well as most forms of
Buddhism fit this definition, and are yet striving toward the
same God we strive toward, even when they do not use the word
God.

There have also been many Sufis throughout the centuries,
whose mystical experiences of union with a formless God,
would place them in a similar category, at least as far as
the fundamentalists are concerned. They do indeed believe in
God, but for the simple fact that their experience of union
with Him transcend form, they would still by definition, be
classified by some, as atheist.

Now that it has been explained that by definition, non-theism
does not necessarily mean that a person rejects God - only
that they do not ascribe form or human characteristics to
God, it should be remembered that in the religion of Islam,
it is considered Shirk (forbidden) to ascribe form to God.
This being the case, from another perspective, some ignorant
person could actually accuse all Muslims of atheism. In
particular, fundamentalist Christians believe that God must
be conceived as a person, which is in direct opposition to
the Islamic injunction against ascribing form of any kind to
God.

This should go to show you that often in this life, labels of
any kind can be very misleading, especially when applied from
the mindset which sees everything from within a mindset of
narrow, black and white views.

Clearly, more education is necessary for many people.

That being said, there are also people who conform to the
common idea of what atheism is. But those are not the people
being referenced here. And most definitely, none of them are
Sufis.

Good luck on your path, and peace be with you.

* What is the significance of Sufi’s whirling dance?

Originally Answered: What is the purpose behind the Sufi
dervish whirling? This will be a non-standard answer. It is
said that when a certain Sufi saint was given a glimpse of
the dhikr (remembrance of God) done by the angels in the
divine court, it transpired to him that some of the angels
where whirling.

It is said by the men of old that in its original form, the
Sufi dervish would levitate while whirling — in imitation of
the angels, because of the degree of connection between him
and act of divine remembrance. Today that connection has been
somewhat attenuated, and the Sufis of the Mevlavi order
continue to whirl, but on the ground, no longer in the air.

Others have pointed out, there is an aspect to the whirling
that mimics the rotation of planets and stars in their
orbits, as well as the motion of the pilgrim around the
Kabba. The cubed temple of God in Mecca.

* What is it like being a Sufi Muslim?

Interesting question : Well it differ from a person to
another .

For me I grew up in a Sufi Family , its customed in our
family respect the elder care for the poor and the needy ,
ethics are very important .

In my journey in life (modest one ) I got to see by time that
we are all equal , religions are only names but most of them
offer a certain value and meaning to human being answers to
after life question and so on . . . ..

what it’s like to be a sufi is seeing yourself as just a
letter of a page of the book called humanity , letters
forming words , each letter is unique …

it’s like seeing as though the future is an illusion the
present as the true reality that you have ..

It’s like knowing that you truly are yourself when you are
alone …

It’s like going on a journey to remove the I from your mind ,
and apreciating the Iness of God …

Is to give importance to human beings because each one of
them is a beautiful part of a beautiful Piece of art done by
God .

It’s like to smile not only in good states but in depression
, and states that cry for tears , you always look for the
meaning in the smile of multistates .

To never judge , never play the role of God .. . .

To see humans with eyes of our hearts , and listen to them
with ears of our hearts .

to get to know that apearances are only a mere illusion the
only truth is the heart ..

To know that this multiverses are created by Love … mercy so
when we love we don’t have to give it a reason a name , just
love …

And ultimately never see yourself as better , each person is
unique , uniqueness cannot be compared , its to be apreciated

**Edit : In the Quran ,Allah said and we sent you (prophet
Mohamed peace be upon him ) solely as a mercy to multiverses
, so if we think we muslims are in truth we must be fools ,
because human kind share it …

* Why is it said that Sufism is only 25% Islam, and 75% an
  amalgamation of Greek, Persian, and Indian thoughts?

Because of the stereotype of Sufism, Islamophobia (in the
West and India) and ignorance

Starting in the early 20th century, Sufism acquired an
extremely positive reputation throughout the world alongside
Buddhism. The idea is that Sufis are essentially pacifistic
Muslims who sit down and meditate all day or hold dances for
everybody to enjoy.


Sufi dance in Turkey

Furthermore Sufism has acquired a positive reputation for a
lot of its thinkers, notably Rumi (who has been whitewashed
to a massive degree), who give it the appearance of a feel
good sect.

So naturally in the 21st century, people noticed the
juxtaposition of stereotypical Sufism and stereotypical Islam

According to modern stereotypes:

Muslims are violent, insane fanatics who will behead anybody
and everybody. But Sufis are suppose to be peaceful hippies
who want to dance and sing.

Muslims are supposed to be of extremely extremely low
intelligence and lowbrow whose thoughts are “Me rape infidel
then me kill the infidel!” But Sufis are suppose to be
natural philosophers who come up with profound sayings.


PersianPoetics is an Iranian blogger who explains how
Westerners mistranslate Rumi into something foreign. The
foreign translation is what gives people the impression that
Sufism is some “feel good” philosophy.

This results in various claims

Some people claim Sufism isn’t even Islam. Not even 1% Islam,
I actually met a Westerner on this site who claims to be a
Sufi but not a Muslim because they said Sufism isn’t Islam.
Some people say Sufism is Islam that merged with other
faiths. One Indian fellow here writes:

Sufism believes in a all encompassing reality or energy.

Islam believes in a god, whom they believe to be superior to
other goods.

(…) Thats why Arab states, where Islam originated considers
Sufism as haram.

Imagine his horror if I tell him Morocco, an Arab state, is
officially Sufi!

But that’s the situation

Sufism has a good reputation while Islam itself doesn’t this
causes many people to come up with their own theories as to
why Sufism exists with many going so far to claim that Sufism
is watered down Islam or not even Islamic.

* Why is Sufism considered shirk and un-islamic by many
  Muslims?

This Salafism vs Sufism is a very big controversy surrounding
Islam. And a lot of people, even the moderate or
non-Salafists hate the Sufis. Some people mix between
different kinds of philosophical positions and tag the Sufis
as non-Muslims. Others believe true Islam is not compatible
with Sufism. I’m going to expound this topic as best as
possible. And also try to clarify the misconceptions people
have regarding Sufism. Okay, this is going to be big but I’ll
try to break it down into different parts to look it more
easy.

1. Concept of: Dualism, Non-Dualism, and Monism (Pantheism)

2. Does Sufism Necessarily have to be Pantheistic?
  a. Controversy surrounding Ibn Arabi’s works
  b. What does the Quran say about Dualism and Non-Dualism?
  c. Was Mansur Al-Hallaj a Pantheist?
  d. Was Mansur Al-Hallaj only executed because of his “Ana-Al-Haq” or his (supposed) pantheistic approach?

3. How does the epistemology of Quran work?
  a. How does the nature of reality work?
  b. The problem of literalistic approach of the Quran
  c. Does the traditional Islam really represent the Salafism or literalistic approach?
  d. Why doesn’t the Salafism want to accept the Sufis?

4. How is Sufism connected to Islam?
As I am just an average Quora user, not a philosopher. So, I
will try to add as many references as possible. Anyway let’s
get started.

The first misconception people possess about the Sufis or
Sufism is in general is that Sufis are pantheists thus they
commit Shirk (Idolatry). Before explaining it, I’m going to
introduce you to different kinds of philosophical positions.

  1. Dualism vs Non-Dualism vs Monism (Pantheism) So, first
     things first. What is dualism or duality?


(A chart on the difference between Dualism and Monism)

Dualism (or Duality) simply means two or dual. Which means that two things are separated.[1] They are distinct from each other. When two entities are separated from each other, it is called dualism or duality.

Now the question comes, what two things? Well, the answer is, it depends. The philosophy of dualism can be based on lots of things. Such as the separation between soul and body, mind and body, matter and intellect, being and non-being etc. Other than just the separation between two things, there is no real definition of dualism. Its an umbrella term.


(Rene Descartes is known for his philosophical approach on mind-body dualism, the “Cartesian Dualism”)

The notion of dualism can be traced back to the philosophy of Pythagoras.[2] But none other philosopher had extended the idea of dualism like the French philosopher, Rene Descartes with his famous quote “Cogito, Ergo Sum” or “I think, therefore I am”. Descartes was very bothered by his source of epistemology and finally concluded that his mind was some kind of a thinking object. And that thinking object is not affected by the outer/material world. And that thinking object is independent from the body (material world).[3] His mind isn’t only based on the sensory experience of the world. Thus Descartes successfully invented (developed) the idea of Cartesian Dualism. And thus he created a distinction between mind and body. And that’s one kind of dualism.

Now, if you’ve understood what dualism is, the question remains,

What is Non-Dualism?
If you have understood what dualism is, then you probably know what non-dualism means. Non-Dualism means, it is not dual.[4] Something that is not dualism. Which means two things are not separated. What two things? Like the concept of Dualism, Non-Dualism is also very vague. There is no real definition of Non-Dualism. Which means it could be of everything as opposed to Dualism. Unity between God and being, mind and body, matter and intellect etc.

What is Monism?
Monism means one. Only one kind of thing[5] . Only one God (not monotheistic though), one substance, one matter etc. Depending on your context, monism means there is only one entity/object. And this leads to the concept of one matter or substance. And this is where the notion of pantheism starts.

What is Pantheism?
Pantheism, like Monism (is actually a part of it) is based on the concept that there is only one reality.[6] And that reality is consisted on one single entity. Which means there can’t be two different realms. Therefore, if one considers there is any kind of God or divinity, then that God doesn’t exist in a separate realm. Which means, God is everything we see. God is the universe.

Below is a chart which describes the difference between theism, pantheism and panentheism.


So, you could see that the concept of pantheism clearly clashes with the concept of theism found in religions, especially the Abrahamic religions - Islam, Judaism, and Christianity.


(Baruch Spinoza’s interpretation on the Cartesian Dualism led him to become a monist)

Now the question is,

Does Non-Dualism necessarily have to be Pantheistic or Monistic?

The answer it, it depends. Well, even though the concept of monism or pantheism can be attributed or derived from nondualism. But not all non-dualism have to be pantheistic or monistic. Because unlike the concept of pantheism, the concept of non-dualism is pretty vague. So, if one denies that the universe is God, and believes there could be some kind of unity between intellect to intellect, then it is not necessarily pantheistic. Pantheism and Monism largely deal with the concept of Material world. I’ll further quote from a philosopher to make it clear.

2. Does Sufism Necessarily have to be Pantheistic?

So, if you’ve read the version of Non-Dualism vs Pantheism. Then now you probably could guess that even though the concept of monism/pantheism may be derived from non-dualism but non-dualism doesn’t always have to be pantheistic. Therefore, Sufism is not necessarily pantheistic. But it may be heavily depended on non-dualism.

That leads to a controversy surrounding the Sufi Shaykh, Ibn Arabi’s doctrine of “Wahadatal Wujud” or “Unity of Being”.

Was Ibn Arabi a pantheist?


(Ibn Arabi)

I’ll quote from a scholar whom I frequently mention on Quora. I’ll quote from Seyyed Hossein Nasr. Nasr says,

“The basic doctrine of Sufism, especially as interpreted by Muhyi al-Din and his school, is that of the transcendent unity of Being (wahdat al-wujud) for which he has been accused by many modern scholars of being a pantheist, a panentheist, and an existential monist; and more recently a follower of what is called natural mysticism. All of these accusations are false, however, because they mistake the metaphysical doctrines of Ibn 'Arabi for philosophy and do not take into consideration the fact that the way of gnosis is not separate from grace and sanctity. The pantheistic accusations against the Sufis are doubly false because, first of all, pantheism is a philosophical system, whereas Muhyi al-Din and others like him never claimed to follow- or create any "system" whatsoever; and, secondly, because pantheism implies a substantial continuity between God and the Universe, whereas the Shaikh would be the first to claim God's absolute transcendence over every category, including that of substance. What is overlooked by the critics who accuse the Sufis of pantheism is the basic difference between the essential identification of the manifested order with its ontological principle and their substantial identity and continuity. The latter concept is metaphysically absurd and contradicts everything that Muhyi al-Din and other Sufis have said regarding the Divine Essence.” - Nasr, Seyyed Hossein (1964). “Three Muslim Sages: Avicenna-Suhrawardi-Ibn Arabi”, part “(Ibn Arabi - The Doctrine)[7]

So, Nasr here clearly denies that Ibn Arabi was ever a pantheist. Cause the notion of pantheism is the unity/relation of God and being from a substantial level. But Ibn Arabi, according to Nasr, already stated that God transcends everything.

Further, another scholar (kinda related to Nasr too), Titus Burckhardt, states,

“All the metaphysical doctrines of the East and some of those of the
West have frequently been labeled as pantheistic, but in truth pantheism is only to be found in the case of certain European philosophers
and in some Orientals who were influenced by Western thought of the
nineteenth century. Pantheism arose from the same mental tendency
which produced, first, naturalism and then materialism. Pantheism
only conceives of the relationship between the Divine Principle and
things from the one point of view of substantial or existential continuity, and this is an error explicitly rejected by every traditional
doctrine” - Burckhardt, Titus (1955), An Introduction to Sufism, Part “Sufism and Pantheism”[8] [9]

Like Nasr, Burckhardt denies the fact that traditional doctrine is pantheistic. Burckhardt further elaborates,

“Again, it must be added that the contemplative never tends to
enclose reality in any single one of its modes—such as substantial continuity—or in any single one of its levels—such as sensory existence
or intelligible existence—to the exclusion of others. On the contrary,
he recognizes innumerable levels of reality, the hierarchy of which is
irreversible, so that one can affirm of the relative that it is in essence
one with its principle,1 or that it “is” its principle, although one cannot say of the principle that it is included in its product. Thus, all
beings are God, if considered in their essential reality, but God is not
these beings and this, not in the sense that His reality excludes them,
but because in the face of His infinity their reality is nil”

Actually there is an entire chapter on “Sufism and Pantheism” from the book. Read the book, I’ve linked the pdf.

Anyway, both Nasr and Burckhardt disagreed calling Ibn Arabi a pantheist. Because the misconception of Sufis being pantheists arises when a person confuses between the continuity of God with Being from the substantial/material point of view.


(According to both Nasr and Burckhardt, the misconception of unity between God and Being on the basis of substantial continuity mislead people to interpret Ibn Arabi’s philosophy pantheistically)

Now, it leads to the second question,

What does the Quran say about Dualism and Non-Dualism?

So, now. To be clear, Quran doesn’t say anything (clearly) about dualism or Non-Dualism.

Though, Quran clearly states that Allah is transcendent and any kind of Shirk or Idolatry is haram but the omnipresent of God is a matter of discuss. But Quran does say something like these,

And to Allah belongs the east and the west. So wherever you [might] turn, there is the Face of Allah. Indeed, Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing - Quran 2:115

Another verse says,

And We have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him, and We are closer to him than [his] jugular vein - Quran 50:16

And then,

Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which is a lamp, the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly [white] star lit from [the oil of] a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire. Light upon light. Allah guides to His light whom He wills. And Allah presents examples for the people, and Allah is Knowing of all things. - Quran 24:35

So, now please don’t ask me whether Quran teaches Dualism or not. Whether Quran is compatible with Non-Dualism or not. But the omnipresent of Allah is a matter of controversy and often becomes misinterpreted as pantheism. In any case, pantheism isn’t compatible with Quran.

Now, I was discussing the topic of omnipresent with a person (a kind of like Guru) out here on Quora. Meanwhile another person [another Guru, Muslim though] discovers a very dark secret of mine. The guy finds out that I [Chris Austin Mahir ] am a secret pantheist! Where does he find it? He finds it from Quora comment section. Like if I were really a pantheist then I’d be commenting it on Quora comment section which is public!

Anyway, this guy mentioned one of the most controversial figures of Sufi Islam, which is my next topic,

Mansur Al-Hallaj,


(Mansur Al-Hallaj)

So, this Mansur Al-Hallaj is the most controversial figure of Sufi Islam. There hasn’t been a single most controversial figure in Sufi Islam than Mansur Al-Hallaj. Why’s he controversial?

First, this Mansur Al-Hallaj is believed to be saying “Ana Al-Haq” or “I am the Truth”. By this people assume that he claimed to be God (Allah). So, people have taken his words as pantheistic. And for that reason he was considered a heretic and then tortured and finally executed. But is it really that simple?

So, to start with Mansur Al-Hallaj I’d mention another scholar whom I often mention [I guess it led some people to believe that I am from Pakistan].


(Mansur Al-Hallaj’s controversial words, “I am the Truth” played a key influence for the development of Muhammad Iqbal’s Khudi)

Anyway, its Muhammad Iqbal. So, this, Iqbal in his early days, regarded (at least knew) Mansur Al-Hallaj and his school as pantheistic,

In his The Development of Metaphysics in Persia he writes,

As a direct consequence of such a view of the Universe, we have the idea of impersonal absorption which first appears in Bāyazīd of Bistām, and which constitutes the characteristic feature of the later development of this school. The growth of this idea may have been influenced by Hindu pilgrims travelling through Persia to the Buddhistic temple still existing at Bāku.[114:2] The school became wildly pantheistic in Ḥusain Manṣūr who, in the true spirit of the Indian Vedantist, cried out, "I am God"—Aham Brahma asmi.
- Iqbal, Muhammad (1908), The Development of Metaphysics in Persia, Chapter V: Sufism, Aspects of Sufi Metaphysics, pg 111[10]

But after the Great War, almost 20 years later, in 1930 Iqbal seemed to change his view. In his Reconstruction he says,

Devotional Sufism alone tried to understand the meaning of the unity of inner experience which the Qur’an declares to be one of the three sources of knowledge, the other two being History and Nature. The development of this experience in the religious life of Islam reached its culmination in the well-known words of Hallāj– “I am the creative truth.” The contemporaries of Hallāj, as well as his successors, interpreted these words pantheistically; but the fragments of Hallāj, collected and published by the French Orientalist, L. Massignon, leave no doubt that the martyr-saint could not have meant to deny the transcendence of God. The true interpretation of his experience, therefore, is not the drop slipping into the sea, but the realization and bold affirmation in an undying phrase of the reality and permanence of the human ego in a profounder personality. The phrase of Hallāj seems almost a challenge flung against the Mutakallimūn. The difficulty of modern students of religion, however, is that this type of experience, though perhaps perfectly normal in its beginnings, points, in its maturity, to unknown levels of consciousness.
- Iqbal, Muhammad (1930). The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, Chapter: 04, The Human Ego – His Freedom and Immortality[11]

Not only the Allama is reluctant to believe that Mansur Al-Hallaj was a pantheist, but also Iqbal uses Hallaj’s words to develop his concept of “Self” which is known as “Khudi”.

On the same chapter Iqbal says,

This vital way of appropriating the universe is what the Qur’an describes as Imān. Imān is not merely a passive belief in one or more propositions of a certain kind; it is living assurance begotten of a rare experience. Strong personalities alone are capable of rising to this experience and the higher “Fatalism” implied in it. Napoleon is reported to have said: “I am a thing, not a person.” This is one way in which unitive experience expresses itself. In the history of religious experience in Islam which, according to the Prophet, consists in the “creation of Divine attributes in man,” this experience has found expression in such phrases as “I am the creative truth” (Hallāj), “I am Time” (Muhammad), “I am the speaking Qur’an” (‘Alī), “Glory to me” (Bā Yazīd). In the higher Sufism of Islam unitive experience is not the finite ego effacing its own identity by some sort of absorption into the Infinite Ego; it is rather the Infinite passing into the loving embrace of the finite.

Iqbal, in fact, believed the words Mansur Al-Hallaj uttered, were not alien to Islam. That’s why he tries to compare Mansur Al-Hallaj’s “I am the Truth” to Prophet Muhammad and Ali. So it seems like, Mansur Al-Hallaj, according to Iqbal, was not a pantheist but a person who had experience the ultimate ego of human being.

So, some people tried manipulating me by saying Hallaj was a pantheist so he was executed on accusation of heresies. But no, it didn’t work on me.

Hallaj wasn’t considered a heretic by all jurists. In fact, the Shafi’E jurist(s) declared that the words Al-Hallaj said weren’t a sign of heresy.[12] Now, that leaves the question.

Why was Mansur Al-Hallaj executed?

Lets believe that Mansur Al-Hallaj was a pantheist. But even then, was Hallaj executed only because of his heresies? I had doubts about his execution. Cause the same Abbasids tortured and imprisoned many scholars whom they didn’t like and let many heretics go. But Mansur Al-Hallaj heresies weren’t even proved. Then?

Turns out, Mansur Al-Hallaj wasn’t executed only because of his “Ana Al-Haq”. Politics played an important role for the execution of Mansur Al-Hallaj. Al-Hallaj was an active opponent who had preached against the corruption of court officials, the viziers. That’s why even though, his heresies couldn’t be proved, he was tortured and executed. The corrupt politicians used Al-Hallaj’s accusation of heresy to disguise their own corruptions. So, religion wasn’t the only reason why Al-Hallaj was executed.[13]

Now it leads to the third section of my answer,

3. How does the epistemology of Quran work?

So, to start here, I’d like to explain how the epistemology works in general.

What is the nature of reality?


(Plato and Aristotle disagreeing with each other. Plato wants to imply that the real knowledge of the universe emanates from the highest formless truth while Aristotle believes the real knowledge comes from this material world. The topic of epistemology has been a matter of debate among the philosophers)

So, I’d like to further elaborate my answer with his topic. How does philosophical epistemology work? (These ideas were inspired by the Western philosophers, especially philosophers like Descartes, Berkeley, and Hume. But I’m keeping it short)

2+2 = 4. Is it true or false?
The sun sets in the West. Is it true or false?
She says the cake tastes delicious. Is she lying or telling the truth?
He says, tomorrow he is going to wear that shirt to the party.
So, I’ve mentioned four possible events. All of these are related to our understanding of epistemology. How does the nature of reality work in general?

So, to answer them,

ans: The first one, 2+2=4 is an absolute truth. (At least considered from all philosophical points of view)
ans: False. The sun doesn’t set in the West. The earth rotates on its axis towards the east.
ans: Yes, she is telling the truth. But it might not taste delicious to me.
ans: He is going to the party wearing that shirt. But if the party gets cancelled at the last moment, then he was never going to wear that shirt.
So, except for the first one, all of our understanding, all of our knowledge seem limited. And that’s how the epistemology, that’s how the nature of reality works.

But why am I saying this?

Because that’s how the Quranic epistemology works. Some Quranic verses are metaphysical, some symbolic, and some literal. There’s no way one could claim that he is following the literal reading of Quran.

For example, there is a Quranic verse

Wa’maaa Angtaa Bihadil W(b)um’E A’waan D’walaalati’Heem Ingtoosmi’Yewoo Illah Ma’Aiyu’u minu Bi’AA’Yatina Fa’HumMuslimun

Or in English,

And you cannot guide the blind away from their error. You will only make hear those who believe in Our verses so they are Muslims - Quran 27:81

So, does that mean the people who are blind are damned forever? The blind cannot receive the revelation?

So, there it goes. A literal interpretation of Quran is impossible. Now someone might say its symbolic. So, even the ones who try to follow Quran literally do admit that Quran sometimes talk in symbolic manner.

And that’s where the early jurists started to develop their Kalam, Sharia etc. Cause reading the Quran and deriving its laws is a very very difficult. And that’s how the Muslim jurists got divided. The creeds I’ve already explained here.[14]

But some people try to claim that the Mutazilites were non-Muslims. They were Kafirs. They were apostates disguised as Muslims. So, just leave the Mutazilites, the metaphysics, the philosophy of Quran alone. But even then, is the theology of Quran still resolved? I don’t think so.

Let me give you an example of an Ashri. He is Imam Al-Juwayni[15] (Al-Ghazali’s mentor). So, so far I have read (and still reading), is that this Al-Juwayni dude was a very stubborn scholar. He was a great debater who used to debate on topics concerning fiqh. The Usul al-Fiqh.[16]

Such as what happens if something isn’t mentioned in the Quran. What about the hadiths? What if hadiths contradict the Quran? Can hadiths become divine law? What if a hadith is not representing the divine law but customary (cultural) law?

So, even if one leaves the philosophy, Kalam or metaphysics of Islam, then there are still topics left for debate such as Usul al-Fiqh. The Muslim jurists from various schools (Madhabs) used to debate between themselves. Not to mention some schools such as the Zahirism[17] , or that of Tabari’s[18] went extinct.

So, who are the Salafists of today to declare this and that version of Islam is correct, when in fact the Salafs didn’t agree between themselves? However, this doesn’t mean there never can be a valid opinion (ruling) of a matter. But most of the time, most of these rules are largely based on debates. At least, that’s what the traditional Muslim scholars understood. So, no Salafism doesn’t represent traditional Islam.

If the Salafists aren’t ready to accept these matters, such as the matters of fuqaha, then how they are going to accept the Sufis who deal with higher metaphysical/philosophical topics of Islam?

So, it now leads to the last section of my answer.

4. How is Sufism connected to Islam?

Let’s say that Sufism is Kufr, Shirk, heresy, apostasy. It is un-Islamic and whatnot. But if I had to mention one scholar who brought Sufism into the mainstream Islam then who that’d be?

I mention this scholar too often. Any of my answers on Sufism couldn’t complete without this guy. In fact, I’ve already mentioned him on this post. This is,


(Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali was one of the first Muslims scholars who integrated the Sufism with Orthodoxy Islam)

Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali. So, whenever I’m debating with a Sufi-hater, I immediately mention this guy. The opponent gets nonplussed.

So, if not Ibn Arabi, if not Mansur Al-Hallaj or any other Sufi, then this guy, Al-Ghazali showed people how to integrate the Orthodox Islam with Sufi Islam.

Al-Ghazali found a complete new way to blend Sufism into Islam. And that’s basically when he was undergoing spiritual crisis.

Ghazali says in his autobiography,

“Then, when I perceived my powerlessness, and when my capacity to make a choice had completely collapsed, I had recourse to God Most High as does a hard pressed man who has no way out of his difficulty. And I was answered by Him Who “answers the needy man when he calls on Him” (27.63/62), and He made it easy for my heart to turn away from fame and fortune, family, children, and associates.” - Ghazali, Abu Hamid, Deliverance From Error (J. Mccarthy), pg 20[19]

Further Ghazali says,

“In general, how can men describe such a way as this? Its purity — the first of its requirements — is the total purification of the heart from everything other than God Most High. Its key, which is analogous to the beginning of the Prayer, is the utter absorption of the heart in the remembrance of God. Its end is being completely lost in God. But the latter is its end with reference to its initial stages which just barely fall under the power of choice and personal acquisition. But these are really the beginning of the Way, and everything prior to it is like an antechamber for him who follows the path to it”

There’s nothing un-Islamic about Sufism. At least the version Al-Ghazali provided. Sufism like I said on my other post, can be consisted of seclusion of the world. Draw oneself away from any kind of food, sex or money. I’ve described it here.[20] Al-Ghazali also emphasized the need for fasting.[21] So, that’s how Al-Ghazali built his version of Sufism. He also said few things such as music which draws people nearer to God can be part of Sufism.[22]

So, you could always get into deeper aspects of Sufi philosophy, but Sufism from its core level, is always Islamic and was drawn from Islam. And I believe the mysticism can be found in other religions too.

Yeah, I admit that some Sufis who worship grave or just dance can commit Shirk (idolatry) but Sufism will always be part of Islam.

I’d like to finish my answer with just one more thing. He’s an Irishman (he’s not Rory Gallagher though)


Although I am not a fan of mixing religions with politics. But I admire the Irish philosopher’s view on religion.[23] Also, worth to mention John Locke too saw the great importance of religion. Not to forget both Edmund Burke and John Locke were founder of British Classical liberalism. If you say they come from medieval era, where people were conservative, then wrong. Thomas Hobbes comes before these two philosophers. But his views on God wasn’t like these two philosophers - Locke and Burke.

So, like I said, even though I don’t support religious (strict) influence on politics, but the complete denial of religions is like denying a part of knowledge. Religion played an important part for the development of philosophy. All the way from Socrates to Friedrich Nietzsche.

As Rene Guenon says,

“Modern man, instead of attempting to raise himself to truth, seeks to drag truth down to his own level”

(Rene Guenon, The Crisis of the Modern World)
