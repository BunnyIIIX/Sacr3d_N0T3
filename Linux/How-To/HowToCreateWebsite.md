------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3 Simple Steps to Make Your Own Website 

You'll learn how to...

* Step 1

Choose a website building platform

* Step 2

Choose a domain and host

* Step 3

Set up, design and tweak your website


## [Step #1]: Choose Your Website Platform

In order to build a website, you first got to decide what platform
you're going to build your website with.


### What do I mean by "platform"?

Well, back in 2005 when I got started with web development, most sites
were created using HTML (code), CSS, and PHP. Each of these took a lot
of time to learn and were difficult to master.

That's why most people still think setting up a website from scratch is
difficult or requires a lot of coding and design skills -- but that's no
longer true.

In 2022, content management systems (CMS) like WordPress have made
creating a website accessible to everyone.

To put it simply, a CMS (or website building platform) is a
user-friendly platform for building websites and managing your own
online content, instead of creating a website from scratch using HTML,
PHP, and other coding languages.


### Popular Site Building Platforms in 2022 

To better understand which are the most popular content management
systems, I dug up some recent statistics from *[W3 Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management)* and *[BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/traffic/Entire-Internet)*.

Just take a look at this graph below:

![CMS Popularity](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201392%20485'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Data credit: BuiltWith

As you can see, **nearly half of the websites on the Internet are
running on the WordPress website platform**.

But what makes them a better option than others?


### Why use WordPress and not website builders?

**1. It's FREE (no recurring subscriptions, open-source)**

Unlike website builders or web design software, WordPress doesn't cost a
dime to download, install or use. It's built by web developers and
there's a large developer community who have 
[designed beautiful free themes and templates](https://wordpress.org/themes/search/website/),
making it easy to get going fast.

**2. It's highly customizable and user-friendly**

If you know how to use Google Docs, you already know how to add your own
content. WordPress can be easily expanded with free add-ons to handle
just about any site you can imagine -- from small business websites to
e-commerce sites. With WordPress "plugins" you'll be able to add contact
forms, subscription forms, image galleries, stores, and so on for your
website. And it's all pretty simple.

***3. Your site will be** '*responsive'*
      **Meaning it'll work on smartphones & tablets, too**

The website you build will instantly be responsive, looking great on
every mobile device, smartphone, and tablet. No need to hire a web
developer for that.

**4. Help available from the community**

With so many people using the platform (webmasters, small-business
owners, bloggers), it's easy to find fast help when you need it. 
You can [get help from here for free](https://wordpress.org/support/) or you can
hire thousands of WordPress developers from [here](https://www.upwork.com/ab/profiles/search/?q=wordpress&user_pref=2).

**In fact, I built *WebsiteSetup.org* using WordPress, too**. Below are
samples of my homepage and 'blog' page:

![WebsiteSetup Homepage](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201392%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

![WebsiteSetup Blog Page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201392%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E)


### Are there any good alternatives for WordPress?

There are some.

But, I would still use WordPress.

- **Wix** is an easy-to-use website builder with a simple drag and
  drop interface, but it has a higher cost, is not suitable for larger
  sites and it's impossible to migrate your website out if the need
  should arise.
- **Squarespace **is a very aesthetically beautiful website builder
  which makes creating beautiful websites easy, but it comes at a
  higher monthly cost and doesn't have a function to migrate your
  website out.
- **Drupal** is a powerful platform that is popular with experienced
  coders and web developers, but it has a high learning curve that
  makes it not the best option for beginners.
- **Joomla** is almost like WordPress and is a good tool for website
  building, but it does require *at least* some basic understanding of
  how to write code to make things work the way that you want.

If you want more details, I've put together a 
[comprehensive comparison between WordPress, Joomla and Drupal](https://websitesetup.org/cms-comparison-wordpress-vs-joomla-drupal/).

If for some reason you don't want to build your site with WordPress,
check out my [Drupal](https://websitesetup.org/build-website-drupal/), [Joomla](https://websitesetup.org/build-website-with-joomla/), [HTML5](https://websitesetup.org/html-tutorial-beginners/) and [website builder](https://websitesetup.org/best-website-builder-tools/)
guides as well.


### WHAT NEXT?

At this point, you don't need go looking for WordPress. Right now, you
don't need to to install it nor download it.

To make sure your website is set up the right way, it's important to
complete the **following steps below:**

**Step 2**, I'll walk you through the process of choosing a domain name
and finding a space to host your site.

Step 3,** I'll show you how to install and customize your WordPress
website. Don't worry -- I'll walk you through the process, with lots of
images as a reference.

## [Step #2]

***Full Disclosure***:
This guide is reader-supported. If you click on our links, we
may earn a commission.
*Thanks for supporting us.*

In order to get a new website online, there are two things that you're
going to need:

- A domain name (a web address like yoursitename.com)
- Website Hosting (a service that connects your site to the internet)

The WordPress platform itself is free, but hosting and domain name are
not. However, the combined cost is still less than a coffee,
with around `$3 -- $5` a month.

In order to look professional, you need to have your own domain name,
instead of having a free domain that belongs to someone else (for
example, yourbusiness.my-free-website.com.)

And, having a quality hosting service will also help you make sure that
your website won't go down and that it loads quickly (very important for
everyone who visits your pages.)


### Where do I get a domain name and hosting?

I've mostly used [www.Bluehost.com](https://websitesetup.org/visit/bluehost/) as a web hosting and
domain registrar for myself and for my web development
projects.

Their website hosting costs less than a movie ticket ($2.75/mo) and
they throw in a FREE domain name (a nice perk to have).

Of course, you can try other web hosting providers and even try to host
your site by yourself, but it's a very complicated process and often
wouldn't be capable of serving your website visitors. So save yourself
some money and get a proper web host.

With your own domain name, you are also able to get a professional email
account(s) like, yourname@YourWebsite.com -- this is much more
professional than a regular Yahoo or Gmail address, specially if you
need multiple email accounts.

Already have a domain name and hosting?
Go ahead and skip to [step 3](#step 3), where I'll explain how you can set up your website.


### What kind of domain name should I pick?

When you're [choosing your domain name](https://websitesetup.org/choose-domain-name/), there are a few
rules you should keep in mind:

- If you're setting up a **business website**, your domain name should
  match your company name. For example: **YourCompanyName.com**
- If you're planning on making a **personal website** for yourself
  then **YourName.com** can be a great option.

For this site (*WebsiteSetup*), I chose WebsiteSetup.org

Domain names usually end with .com, .org or .net, but in recent times, a
large number of domain extensions (the last part of the web address,
like .com or .org) have come out, ranging from .blog to .party.

**My best advice?** Avoid the unusual extensions and go with .com, .net
or .org unless they precisely describe your website -- and even then, it
is usually better to go with a more common extension.


### Any additional tips for choosing my domain name?

There are a few things that can help you choose your domain name:

**#1 Is it brandable?** For example, if you make a site about poetry
then best-poetry-website.net is not a good choice: poetryacademy.com or
poetryfall.com is much better.

**#2 Is it memorable?** Short, punchy and clear domain names are much
easier to remember. If your domain name is too fuzzy, too long or
spelled in a strange way, visitors may forget it.

**#3 Is it catchy?** You want a domain name that rolls off the tongue,
describes what you (or your business) does and sticks in the head.
Coming up with a cool name can be a bit tough since there are more than
[200 million active domain names](https://research.domaintools.com/statistics/tld-counts/) in the
world right now -- but don't give up.

There's one rule that always applies to domain names: **If you like it,
go for it.**


### WHAT NEXT?

Do some brainstorming to come up with a unique domain name
that reflects your future website, business or blog.

Secure your web hosting and domain name. For this, I
recommend using [Bluehost.com](https://websitesetup.org/visit/bluehost1/), but you can pick
[any web host](https://websitesetup.org/best-web-hosting-sites/) that's reliable and trustworthy.

UPDATE: I made a simple guide on how to get started with
Bluehost [which hosting package to choose & how to install WordPress](https://websitesetup.org/how-to-sign-up-with-bluehost/).

## [Step #3]

**If you have any questions/suggestions for this guide don't hesitate
to [contact me](https://websitesetup.org/free-help/). Remember: I'm here
to help!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Install WordPress Site

There are two possible ways to install WordPress, one MUCH easier than
the other.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 1. TO CREATE A WEBSITE WITH WORDPRESS, USE ONE-CLICK-INSTALLATION:

Almost all well-established and reliable web hosting companies have
integrated one-click installation for WordPress these days.

If you chose to sign up with
[Bluehost](https://websitesetup.org/visit/bluehost2/) or any other
similar hosting company, you should find your "one-click installation"
either in the account creation process or in your account control panel.

For example, these are the steps you need to follow to install WordPress
on Bluehost (the process is very similar or even the same on all the
most popular web hosting companies):

1. Go to **[Bluehost.com](https://websitesetup.org/visit/bluehost3/)**
2. Choose your hosting plan (cheapest plan is fine)
3. If you already have a domain, type it there
4. Fill in your information and choose your hosting length (you can
   remove the "Extras").
5. Go through the payment process and create your account
6. Log in to Bluehost use "one-click WordPress install" to Install
   WordPress

[Watch this video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/-56zMchAhh4)

If you're unable to locate it, look here: 
[How to Install WordPress on Bluehost](https://websitesetup.org/how-to-sign-up-with-bluehost/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2. MANUAL INSTALL (if your web hosting provider doesn't have an easy way to do it)** **

If for some odd reason (some hosting companies don't provide
one-click-install for WordPress) you don't have the option to install
WordPress automatically, look at this **manual guide** below:

[**Installing WordPress Manually (Click to expand)**](#)

1) Download WordPress from here: [http://wordpress.org/download](https://wordpress.org/download/)

2) Create a new folder on your desktop and unzip WordPress in it

3) Look for a file named *wp-config-sample.php* and rename it
to: *wp-config.php*

4) Now open the wp-config.php (with notepad for example) and fill the
following lines:

- define('DB_NAME', 'database_name_here'); -- Database name (if you
  don't know it, ask this from your hosting support)
- define('DB_USER', 'username_here'); -- Your hosting username
- define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here'); -- Your hosting password

After you have filled the gaps, save the file.

5) Now log into your hosting ftp (download
[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) for that). The FTP address
is usually ftp.yourdomain.com, username and password are the same that
you used to register to your host.

6) If there is any file named "index" -- delete it. After that upload
all the files from your WordPress folder to your FTP server. I believe
you can use the "drag n drop" function in FileZilla.

7) Once you have completed the previous steps, go the
URL: *yourdomain.com/wp-admin/install.php*

This is the page you should see:

![Installing WordPress Manually](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201392%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Just fill in the forms and you are ready!

*If they don't have 1-click-installation, you may want to consider that
you are dealing with a bad host!*


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Choose a Theme for Your Site (Free or Premium)

For the next step, we'll be diving into [WordPress themes](https://websitesetup.org/top-wordpress-themes/) 
and how to use and customize them.

WordPress themes are design templates that make changing your site's
looks a lot quicker and easier.

Luckily, WordPress has loads of themes to choose from.
The [official WordPress theme directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/) alone contains
more than 8,000, which are completely free to use.

You can access themes directly from within WordPress without having to
navigate to an external site.

For that, simply go to ***Appearance > Themes***, and click the large +
sign that says ***Add New Theme***.

![Add New Theme WordPress](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201384%20772'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Then use the search bar to find a theme that suits your site.

![Finding a new theme](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201384%20895'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
You can click on any theme in the listing to view a demo of it and read
more about its features on its *Details & Preview* screen.

Once you find a theme you like, install it by clicking the *Install*
button in the *Details & Preview* screen.

![Install New Theme](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201384%20668'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Once the install process is complete, click the *Activate* button that
appears where the *Install* button used to be.

If what's available in the official theme directory doesn't suit your
needs, check out premium theme markets such as:

- [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net)
- [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com)
- [MOJO Marketplace](https://www.mojomarketplace.com)
- [Elegant Themes](https://www.elegantthemes.com)
- [Themify](https://themify.me)
- [StudioPress](https://www.studiopress.com)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Add Content (Pages and Posts)

Before getting to site customization, you need to have some content on
your site.

After all, it's hard to customize your site when there's nothing on it
to show the changes. What you need in terms of content will vary
depending on the subject matter of your site and your goals.

However, there are a few key pages that nearly every site has:

- Homepage
- About page
- Contact page

In deciding [which pages to add](https://www.sba.gov/blog/5-essential-pages-your-small-business-website),
consider what information would be most helpful to your visitors. You'll
also need to think about visual content, such as photos.

To make things easier, some WordPress themes come with page templates
for specific page types. Others also come with more than one layout
option for each page.

To take advantage of these, go to ***Appearance > Customize***.

In this example, we're using the latest WordPress default theme, Twenty
Twenty-One to create a site. By default, it uses a static page as the
homepage that you can configure under *Homepage Settings*. Use the
dropdown menu to select which page you want to serve as your website's
homepage.

![homepage displays latest posts](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201384%20605'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Alternatively, if you want your homepage to feature your latest blog
posts, check choose the option *Your latest posts*.

Confirm your choices by clicking *Publish* in the upper left corner.

After that, you can move on to creating new pages for your site. For
that, in the main dashboard, go to ***Pages > Add New***.

![Add New Page WordPress](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201384%20557'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The Twenty Twenty-One theme relies on the Gutenberg editor, so here I
can add page titles and content.

![2021 theme gutenberg editor](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201384%20641'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Within this page, you can add features like images and formatting.

Repeat this process to add additional pages to your site.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Make Sure Your Website is Well-Organized

Think of your website as a library.

Your website structure will become increasingly important the more
content you add to your website.

When learning how to create a website, you need to get
[expert at organizing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-10-enduring/?lm=ten-good-deeds-in-web-design&pt=article)
your site in a way that makes sense to your visitors and easy for them
to get around it.

A crucial part here is the navigation menu. Once you've created some
pages, it's time to make them available to your visitors on the site.
You can do that under ***Appearance > Menus***.

![WordPress Setup a Menu](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201392%20720'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The first step here, is to give your new menu a name, then click *Create
Menu*.

After that, you can choose which content to add to it on the left. For
example, tick the boxes next to pages you want to appear in the menu,
then click *Add to Menu*.

You can drag and drop menu items to your desired order and even turn
them into sub-items by moving them underneath others like below. Once
you are satisfied, choose the menu position where you'd like for this
menu to appear (in this case *Primary menu*).

Click *Save Menu* again and go to your site's front end to see the new
menu in action.

![new wordpress website preview](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201184%20539'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Ultimately, you want to reflect a structure that makes sense for your
site and helps visitors get to where they need to go.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Additional Customization Options

For additional customization options, go back to ***Appearance >
Customize***. When you look around, you will see that it offers a lot
more options to make changes to your site. You are able to modify other
parts of your site like:

- Title and tagline
- Colors
- Typography
- Background image
- Menus
- Widgets

You can also make adjustments to your homepage, blog page, and add
custom code. The options that appear will vary depending on which theme
you've installed.

![Customizing WordPress Theme](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201392%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Beyond theme customization, there are many [plugins available for WordPress](https://websitesetup.org/best-popular-wordpress-plugins/),
both free and premium. In the official [WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) alone, you can find close to
60,000 plugins that can add all kinds of new features and functionality
to your site. Plus, there are many more available from third-party
marketplaces.

To install new plugins, navigate to ***Plugins > Add New***.

![Adding Plugins WordPress](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201392%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

You'll be presented with a list of some of the most popular plugins
currently available. Use the search field to find anything else you are
looking for.

To get plugins onto your site, hit the *Install Now* button. Wait until
it has been downloaded and then click *Activate*. You can find all
plugins on your site plus the possibility to activate, deactivate, and
delete them under *Plugins* in the WordPress main menu.

As to what plugins you should install, some choices worth considering
include:

- [Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) -- A top
  search engine optimization plugin that adds on-page optimization
  prompts to every page and post plus the option to customize Open
  Graph social media tags.
- [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/) -- Includes a wide range of features
  to improve website speed, optimization, social media integration,
  digital marketing, contact forms, and site search.
- [Smush](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/) -- This plugin
  compresses images that are uploaded to WordPress, which saves
  storage space, and speeds up page load times.
- [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) -- This is
  the most popular e-commerce store plugin for WordPress and makes it
  easy to set up an online store. More on it further below.
- [MonsterInsights](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/)
  -- This plugin adds Google Analytics to your WordPress dashboard.

If you want even more control over how your website looks, you can
install a page builder plugin. These plugins add drag-and-drop
functionality to your site, which means you can visually build entire
web designs --- not just individual pages and posts. A few popular
choices include:

- [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) -- This
  all-in-one website builder offers visual website editing, fast load
  times, and a vast selection of templates to choose from.
- [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/) -- Developed by
  Elegant Themes, Divi provides another straightforward way to
  customize websites.
- [Beaver Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beaver-builder-lite-version/)
  -- An easy-to-use page builder plugin that speeds up website design
  considerably.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Add a Blog (Optional)

Not every website needs a blog. However, creating one can be a good idea
to regularly publish fresh content, display your expertise, and provide
additional value for your visitors.

To add a blog in WordPress, you first have to select a blog page. Above,
I have already covered that you can configure your homepage to
automatically display your latest posts. However, if you want a
dedicated blog page instead and keep your homepage static, you first
need to create it.

This is as simple as setting up an empty page (***Pages > Add New***),
naming it *Blog* (or whatever you want but *Blog* makes sense because it
will automatically create the address *yoursite.com/blog* for your blog
page), and publishing it. Then, pick it as your *Posts Page* either
under *Appearance > Customize > Homepage Settings* or under *Settings
> Reading*.

![wordpress homepage settings](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201392%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

When saved, all blog posts will automatically appear on your chosen
page. Don't forget to add it to your navigation menu!

To add blog posts to your website go to ***Posts > Add New*.**

This will get you to the same content editor that you used earlier for
your pages. Add a title and content to your blog post. Include images
and formatting, headers, lists, and anything else it needs. In the
sidebar on the right you also find options to apply categories and tags,
define an excerpt, and set up a featured image.

Once you're done making changes, click *Publish.* Your first post is
completed, well done!

### 7. Adding an Online Store (Optional)

Not every website needs an ecommerce store. But if you want to know how
to make a website and include an online store, keeping reading.

The most popular plugin for this purpose is
[WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).

You can set it up quickly, it offers many payment options, and a wide
range of optimized themes to create an online shop. Plus, it has a
variety of extensions available for purchase to customize your
e-commerce site and adapt it to many purposes.

### 8. Configure SSL

A secure sockets layer (SSL) on your website means data sent to your
website's visitors is kept secure. SSL is an important search ranking
factor, and it's essential to ensure a positive user experience by
prioritizing user privacy and security.

To check that SSL is active on your new website with Bluehost, do the
following:

1. Log into Bluehost.
2. Go to *My Sites*.
3. Click *Manage Site*.
4. Find the *Security* tab on the next screen.
5. Under the section that says *Security Certificate*, verify your
   *Free SSL Certificate* or *SSL Certificate: Let's Encrypt* status.
   The toggle should be switched to *On.*
6. Verify SSL is set up by visiting your site again. A lock icon should
   appear next to the domain name in your web browser's address
   bar.![Configure SSL](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201384%20852'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

### 9. Launch Your WordPress Website

Once your site is ready, it's time to officially launch it. Make sure to
double-check your settings and proofread your posts and pages one more
time. If everything looks good, click the link at the top of the
dashboard that says *Coming Soon Active*.
  ![launching wordpress website coming soon live](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201384%20814'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

After that, scroll down and hit the button that says *Launch your site*.
  ![website pre-publishing](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201384%20387'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Now you can check your live website.

Click through each page to make sure all links work, your text looks
good, and your images are formatted properly (you can [use this checklist for reference](https://websitesetup.org/website-launch-checklist/)).
